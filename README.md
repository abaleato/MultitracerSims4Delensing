Given theoretical auto- and cross-spectra, generate Gaussian simulations of LSS tracers which are approrpriately correlated with each other and with an input convergence. Then compute and implement the optimal co-adding weights as derived in [arXiv:1502.05356] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05356)
 for the purpose of delensing.
